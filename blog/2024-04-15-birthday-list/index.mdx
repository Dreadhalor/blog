# 100 Days of Code 1: Birthday List

Sup, yo. We gonna make this today:

![Birthday List](./birthday_list.webp)

This challenge is from [ICodeThis](https://icodethis.com/modes/design-to-code/39).

& we're gonna use Tailwind, because it's as awesome as CSS files aren't.

<BirthdayList />

<br />

So there you go, it's basically the same thing but with the font looking less 'clean'
somehow. I do not know how to do fonts, & for the time being I'll just have to live
with that.

If you'd like to interact with the code for this yourself, you can check out some live coding examples below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='live' label='Live Code'>
    <LiveCodeExample />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='codesandbox' label='CodeSandbox'>
    <CodeSandboxExample />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
