# 100 Days of Code 1: Birthday List

Sup, yo. We're gonna make this today:

![Birthday List](./birthday_list.webp)

{/* truncate */}

This challenge is from [ICodeThis](https://icodethis.com/modes/design-to-code/39/submissions).

& we're gonna use Tailwind, because it's as awesome as CSS files aren't.

<BirthdayList />

<br />

So there you go, it's basically the same thing but with the font looking less 'clean'
somehow. I do not know how to do fonts, & for the time being I'll just have to live
with that.

SO, what did I learn today? I mostly knew how to code this pretty easily, but I did learn a bit about using Tailwind to make gradients & box shadows. Mostly, I learned a lot about very specific configurations pertaining to Docusaurus to display this code in the first place.

If you'd like to interact with the code for this yourself, you can check out some live coding examples below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='codesandbox' label='CodeSandbox (Recommended)'>
    <CodeSandboxExample />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='live' label='Live Code (Locally Hosted)'>
    <LiveCodeExample />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
