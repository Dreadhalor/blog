& here's a CodeSandbox of it for you to play with if you want a better idea of how I actually organized the files & would like to leverage the full power of TailwindCSS - I had to import Tailwind thru a CDN but it's otherwise identical.

Frankly, I would recommend using this over the live code example above as it gives you more tools to use (at the cost of not being locally hosted), but I wanted
to show you both options.

  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    border: '0',
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title='birthday-list'
></iframe>
