# 100 Days of Code 7: Social Login

Here's the prompt for today:

![Social Login](./social_login.webp)

{/* truncate */}

[Challenge from ICodeThis](https://icodethis.com/modes/design-to-code/45/submissions)

& this time, we'll time it. Just for fun, we'll time the Figma portion separately from the coding portion.

Figma mockup, time starts now!

Mockup done! Looks like 31 minutes. Seems passable I guess, but I definitely
lost a lot of time with little things you can easily do in code that I don't
have a clear analogue for in Figma, such as those dots as the bottom. In code
I'd just set the alignment to be the bottom of the container & then give them a
negative margin to move them down, but Figma doesn't seem to have that. Figma
not letting you set margins in general is pretty annoying, but it's still a good
software.

Okay, let's see if I can finish the code in time to still fit in a bike ride while the sun is out. Fortunately it's the summer so 4pm is still pretty bright.

Coding time starts now!

Done! Looks like it was 38 minutes. Not super stoked about that. When I started
going I had the horrible realization that I had, once again, chosen extremely
small fonts so I hda to arbitarily resize some stuff to make the font looks
readable without needing to zoom in. It is comical how bad I am at fonts.

Also, turns out you can't put children inside of an `<input />` tag? How have I never come across this before? Either way, it wasted a decent chunk of time having to work around that.

Either way, not stoked but not super disappointed! I like the idea of speed-coding these, especially because I'm working on some big projects outside of this so it incentivizes me to be efficient with my time without just saying "screw it" like I may have done yesterday.

I swear I spent all day coding, I just didn't necessarily have a deliverable!

Now let's end this challenge with a CodeSandbox for you to check out:
