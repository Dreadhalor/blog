Hi there

We need to make an app tutorial thing

Let's start describing what it is/does

So it's Dropbox

A user needs to be able to do a couple of things:

- CRUD operations: files
  - Upload (create) files
  - Delete files
  - Rename files
  - Relocate files

Random bits of philosophy I want to rant about:

- full stack doesn't exist anymore
- it's about integration of 3rd party APIs, cloud computing + completely pointless SSR
- why primitives are better than libraries (level of abstraction)
