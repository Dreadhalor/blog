# 100 Days of Code 6: Movie Ticket

Let's do a more complicated one today. Here's the prompt:

![Movie Ticket](./movie_ticket.webp)

{/* truncate */}

[**Challenge from ICodeThis**](https://icodethis.com/modes/design-to-code/64/submissions)

Okay, let's start with a mockup in Figma:

<FigmaEmbed url='https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FQrKIAN97UZsjVjl5m8BnDD%2F100-Days-of-Code-6%253A-Movie-Ticket%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DUoAhHI6udkjm3TYn-1' />
<br />
Okay, now time to code!

<MovieTicket />
<br />
Time! It was super late when I started so I did the seat grid in the morning,
but with a ~good~ night's sleep the seat grid wasn't too bad. I love how I
thought the "Screen" graphic would be a drag but it turns out Figma generated an
svg for me & I just copy+pasted the code & boom, done. Wild, yo.

...speaking of time, I should actually start timing myself on these. Modern web dev is more about development speed than program speed at this point, after all.

& I still have much to learn about fonts, because clearly even though I've improved a lot by using Figma to figure out fonts instead of just "guessing" in code, the font sizes I keep using are comically tiny & that's just odd.

Last but not least, here's a CodeSandbox version of the code for you to look at yourself:
